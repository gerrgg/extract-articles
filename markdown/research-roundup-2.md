### Engineers Rush to Nepal’s Aid

**The challenge:** The April 25 earthquake and aftershocks that hit Nepal caused more than 3,000 landslides in the small country, some of which wiped out entire villages and further destabilized the geology of high-altitude mountains, glaciers and glacial lakes. Luckily, none of the 21 glacial lakes in the Nepal region have burst out of their natural environments in the mountains, but the threat remains.

**The breakthrough:** In May, environmental engineering professor Daene McKinney and a team of experts deployed to Nepal to make a rapid assessment of several of the potentially dangerous lakes, including Imja Lake in the Khumbu region.

The RAPID response mission was part of the High Mountains Adaptation Partnership (HiMAP), created and managed by The University of Texas at Austin and The Mountain Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit focused on the conservation of mountain environments. HiMAP received $100,000 for this effort from the United States Agency for International Development, UT Austin, the American Society of Civil Engineers and private donors to cover travel, field support, helicopter costs and other project costs.

Between June and August, the researchers conducted detailed remote sensing and field-based assessments of the glacial lakes. By fall, the team was able to deliver their post-earthquake assessment report of three glacial lakes in Nepal, providing the Nepalese government with risk-reduction engineering methods to keep the lakes in place.

### GPS Tracking on a Granular Scale

**The challenge:** Today, the GPS technology in our mobile devices can tell our location anywhere on Earth to several meters of accuracy. That might be fine for Google Maps, but aerospace engineering associate professor Todd Humphreys and his team of graduate students in the Radionavigation Lab think that GPS technology should be better and enable more applications.

**The breakthrough:** Humphreys and his team built the first centimeter-accurate GPS receiver for a smartphone. The key to the system is a powerful and sensitive software-defined GPS receiver that can extract centimeter accuracies from the inexpensive antennas found in mobile devices.

The researchers are working to perfect the technology, but they can already envision unmanned aerial vehicles delivering packages to a specific spot on a consumer’s back porch, improved collision avoidance technologies in cars and virtual reality headsets used to play multi-player games outdoors.

### Beyond the Selfie

**The challenge:** We take out our smartphones to snap a picture of our gourmet dinner or shoot a video of our family vacation. But depending on lighting and the steadiness of the photographer’s hand, these photos may be grainy or otherwise distorted. Electrical and computer engineering professor Alan Bovik and his team are accepting the challenge of developing better cameras for our mobile phones and devices.

**The breakthrough:** With a $450,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, Bovik is developing “distortion-aware” computer vision models and algorithms suitable for today’s mobile camera devices. Beyond better selfies, this research could help improve critical devices, including mobile medical camera devices and low-cost surveillance and security cameras.

Bovik’s team will use new and emerging models of visual neuroscience (how people see) and detailed and accurate statistical models of the 3-D visual world (called natural scene statistic models). They plan to incorporate natural scene statistic models into sophisticated computer vision algorithms for object detection and categorization, and 3-D scene understanding.

### A Nature-Inspired, Non-Toxic Flame Retardant

**The challenge:** Manufacturers place flame retardants in everything from mattresses and sofas to car upholstery and baby products to help buy valuable time in the event of a fire. But as scientific evidence mounts about the dangers that flame retardants pose when their chemicals leak out of products into our environment, people are searching for alternatives.

**The breakthrough:** A team led by chemical engineering associate professor Christopher Ellison found that a coating of polydopamine can be used as a highly effective, non-toxic and water-applied flame retardant for polyurethane foam.

The researchers’ flame retardant is derived from the natural compound dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays various roles in the human brain and body. The dopamine was transformed into the polymer polydopamine that cannot easily leech out or be absorbed by humans. The team was inspired by the way marine mussels secrete the compound to stick to virtually any surface — an important quality for flame retardants, which are often applied as coatings onto foam and other products.

On top of being based on a non-toxic compound, the team’s flame retardant is good at resisting fire. The team found that the polydopamine coating on foams leads to a 67 percent reduction in peak heat release rate, a measure of fire intensity and imminent danger to a building’s occupants or firefighters. In lab tests, the polydopamine fire retardant reduced the fire intensity by about 20 percent over many existing flame retardants.

### A TSUNAMI Hits Cancer

**The challenge:** In the fight against cancer, every tiny molecule and its movement matters. So when a team of biomedical engineers spotted a void in the ability of researchers to track molecular movement of single epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) — an important membrane receptor in cancer growth — they went to work.

**The breakthrough:** Evan Perillo, a biomedical engineering graduate student working with professor Andrew Dunn and assistant professor Tim Yeh, designed a super-resolution microscope that could help researchers better understand cancer.

The imaging system, called TSUNAMI, can image molecular movement of EGFRs traveling at high speed, with a time resolution much faster than what a camera can achieve. TSUNAMI is also capable of imaging at a very small scale, 10 times smaller than the current standard.

By tracking where these super-fast receptors travel, researchers will gain a better understanding of the disease’s behavior and be better informed to provide approaches for prohibiting cancer growth.

### A Rehab Robot Named HARMONY

**The challenge:** When it comes to physical therapy for patients with spinal and neurological injuries, mechanical engineering assistant profressor Ashish Deshpande and his team of graduate students from the Rehabilitation and Neuromuscular Robotics Lab think existing treatment methods need to evolve.

**The breakthrough:** Deshpande and his team have introduced HARMONY, a robotic exoskeleton designed to work with physical therapists to deliver full upper-body therapy with natural motion and tunable pressure and force. HARMONY is different from many therapeutic devices in that it feels weightless to patients.

And, unlike conventional rehab, HARMONY can provide real-time data to assist therapists in customizing exercises for patients. The rehab robot is programmed to maximize the patient’s participation in the therapy exercise, which is important for a speedy recovery. HARMONY can also determine if a patient isn’t performing an exercise correctly, which is critical to preventing further injury. The efficiency of such data-driven care could improve therapy outcomes and eventually help lower the cost of rehabilitation.

### Digital Rock Age

**The challenge:** Our understanding of rocks and soil is important to society and various industries, including construction, energy and medicine. But for now, the vast and valuable rock microstructure data collected by scientists and engineers is not easy to access.

**The breakthrough:** Petroleum and geosystems engineering assistant professor Maša Prodanović and a team of leading UT Austin scientists are taking on the big task of changing the way researchers use and collect large volumetric datasets of geologic materials.

The National Science Foundation selected Prodanović, research associate Maria Esteva of the Texas Advanced Computing Center and professor Richard Ketcham of the Jackson School of Geosciences for a two-year, $600,000 grant to build a Digital Rocks Portal utilizing the latest technologies in data storage.

Recent advancements in high-resolution imaging techniques have provided a wealth of 3-D datasets that reveal the microstructure of rocks and soil, which in turn serve as the basis for sophisticated computer modeling of fluids moving through pore networks.

The project will result in a large, highly organized platform for sharing and downloading rock data. This emerging research can inform important decisions in petroleum, environmental and civil engineering.
