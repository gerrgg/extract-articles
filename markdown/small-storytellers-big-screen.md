Many aspiring filmmakers wait years for their work to debut at an Austin film festival. Some just have the right fourth-grade teacher.

On a Tuesday morning just days after torrential April rains, 24 young filmmakers arrived at the Alamo Drafthouse on Slaughter Lane for the inaugural 2016 Alexander Film Festival. They were about to view their personal work on a big screen for the first time.  

The festival, named for Cowan Elementary fourth-grade teacher and UT College of Education alumna Kerry Alexander, featured a short film created by each of the students. They based their films on written work they had created for Alexander’s class.  Their collaborators were 22 UT College of Education student-teachers who helped draft, design, revise, and record their stories over nine weeks.

The audience of filmmakers and their parents munched on popcorn, laughed, and cried, watching as their stories—told with varying levels of writing, technical, drawing, and English language skills—came to life on the big screen. These documentaries, how-to’s, works of fiction, and montages of ethereal poetry were mined from journals each student wrote during the school year.

One student shared his wide-ranging fascination and knowledge of skateboarding and Russia. Another illustrated a case of disputed identity—cupcake or muffin?—that crescendoed toward a hilarious showdown between rival breakfast foods. Another film detailed a young girl’s immigration from Costa Rica to Austin.  It was a story that her student-teacher coach, a first-generation college student and UT junior, shared, as she had also immigrated to America as child. 

“This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,” Alexander says. “Our fourth-graders got to see their creative ideas come to fruition with one-on-one coaching from a cohort of young, creative, smart almost-teachers.” She notes that the project would not have been possible without a collaborative relationship with College of Education Clinical Assistant Professor Katie Russell. Russell’s student teachers were participants in a spring semester language and literacy class, learning best practices for teaching young students to read and write.

The idea of bridging digital storytelling with a traditional literacy class germinated when collaborator and fellow language and literacy Clinical Assistant Professor Audra Roach was a doctoral student at UT. “In addition to being interested in teacher education, I was interested in writing and storytelling, so I would visit the digital writing and research lab on campus to see how college students in rhetoric and composition courses learn to compose with print, video, and sound. I wondered what it might look like to bring that technology into the K-12 classroom and teacher education.” She and Russell created a pilot class in their Methods of Teaching Language Arts course for first graders and expanded the program this year with Alexander’s fourth graders.

The film festival became a reality when Alamo Drafthouse was enlisted to screen the students’ work.

“The fourth graders are true digital natives,” Roach notes, even more so than the Millennials in the student-teacher cohort, many of whom “were a bit apprehensive about using filmmaking tools for the first time.” But the student teachers developed increased proficiency with the technology, just as the fourth-graders developed increased facility with more structured writing—from drafting, reporting, and genre-writing—with the help of their mentors.

“The students let us into their writing lives,” says Russell, “and we had a chance to honor their ideas and the writing craft.”

Matthew Odam, Austin American-Statesman features and food writer, attended the film festival. He spoke to the filmmakers, recognizing their achievement and commending their bravery. “We tell our stories to connect to others. It’s a lot of hard work, but the feeling of finishing and seeing the work in the world is a joy.”

He told the beaming students, “You aren’t _aspiring_ writers or creators; you _are_ writers. Keep leaning in to the creative inspiration that you have.”
