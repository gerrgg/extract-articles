### Discrimination’s Aftermath

Understanding racial and ethnic differences can start very early. By the age of 5, many children can recognize racial or ethnic groups. By 10, many know discrimination when they see it —including when they themselves are targeted.

Hundreds of studies have tracked how racial and ethnic discrimination affects children’s development, but Aprile Benner, an associate professor of human development and family sciences at The University of Texas at Austin, led a team that reviewed them comprehensively, assessing — across more than 200 peer-reviewed studies of over 90,000 youths — how discrimination affected adolescents’ mental and physical health, behavior choices and academic performance. Benner and the team concluded: “Racial and ethnic discrimination influences all aspects of adolescents’ daily lives and well-being.” 

The extent of discrimination’s impact varies, and how parents interact with youths about experiences with discrimination appears to play a role. For example, Benner’s team found Latino students, especially boys, tended to experience poorer outcomes from discrimination compared with African American students. The team theorized that African American families have more conversations with their children to prepare them for the biases that surface too often in daily life. 

Benner’s colleague in the department, Fatima Varner, explores the link between parenting and how youths respond to prejudice. African American youths whose parents remain closely involved and engaged after their child experiences a racially discriminatory event do better.

“Supportive parenting is linked to a host of positive outcomes for youths – from academic achievement to better social engagement,” Varner said. “Parents have a critical protective role to play against the impact of racial discrimination.”

There is a role for other adults, too. “We need to be asking,” Benner said, “What can we all do to intervene to try to reduce discriminatory treatment?”

### Exoplanet A.I.

Until NASA retired it in 2018, the Kepler Space Telescope sent all the interesting data it could collect about stars from space to Earth. Which of these points were useful and which weren’t would get decided later, as information from its unique vantage point was recorded.

Even now, so much data remains from its nine years in orbit that researchers are still making discoveries from the archives it left behind.

That includes researchers like Anne Dattilo, who was an astronomy undergraduate at The University of Texas at Austin when, with the help of artificial intelligence, she discovered two new planets hiding in Kepler’s K2 mission data.lanets.

A member of Women in Natural Sciences and an alumna of the Freshman Research Initiative, Dattilo used the A.I. called AstroNet-K2 to find planets. She fed it data on known examples, a process known as “supervised learning.” Then AstroNet-K2 found two new examples that fit a similar profile, previously unknown planets outside our solar system, or exoplanets, unlovingly labeled K2-293b and K2-294b. The pair were later confirmed by ground-based telescope observations.

Creating an automatic, unbiased system to identify signals of interest— in this case, a temporary dimming of starlight that occurs when a planet orbits its star — is only the beginning, according to Dattilo, who is now in graduate school.

“There may be unusual planetary systems out there that are interesting but would not be recognized by our model,” she observed. This means the A.I. method, if applied to other data sets or telescopes, “could potentially find highly valuable, previously missed planets.”

### Twisted Physics

Professor Allan MacDonald wondered what would happen if you stacked two atom-thin sheets of a material called graphene on top of each other, but with a slight twist so the atoms in one sheet didn’t perfectly line up with atoms on the other. Using supercomputers at the Texas Advanced Computing Center, he and another researcher modeled the problem of twisted bilayer graphene and found that at a very specific angle electrons in the model behaved in a strange and extraordinary way.

MacDonald, who holds the Sid W. Richardson Foundation Regents Chair in Physics, was surprised to see the atoms suddenly moved more than 100 times more slowly at the 1.1 degree angle. Discovering this “magic angle” effectively launched a new subfield called twistronics.

For decades, scientists have worked to find a material that can transport electricity with perfect efficiency — or superconduct — at something like room temperature. (Current superconductors require closer to absolute-zero temperatures.) Such a discovery would have implications for quantum computing and for efficient sources of electricity. In 2018, scientists demonstrated that bilayer graphene twisted at MacDonald’s magic angle exhibits superconductivity — and at a surprisingly high temperature, too.

Earlier this year, MacDonald won the Wolf Prize, one of the most prestigious prizes in physics. He continues to make discoveries about magic-angle graphene, including with research findings that suggest great promise for future advances in electronics and improvements in energy.

“The thing that’s energized my work is that nature is always posing new problems,” MacDonald said. “When you ask a new type of question, you don’t know in advance what the answer is or where the adventure will lead.”

### When Fear Floods Back

![hippocampus](http://research.utexas.edu/showcase/assets/js/fileman/Uploads/hippocampus.jpg)

Since the time of Pavlov and his dogs, scientists have known that frightening memories we thought we had put behind us can sometimes pop up at inconvenient times. UT neuroscientists recently found that a very specific group of cells in the brain are to blame. Michael Drew, a University of Texas at Austin associate professor, identified the neurons that, when activated, suppress scary memories and when inactivated cause those negative memories to resurface. His finding explains both how this process works in the brain and where (not in the amygdala, which dictates other fear memories, but in the hippocampus, the part of the brain involved with other types of recall).

The discovery may prove helpful for health professionals working to make more effective decisions about treating anxiety, phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder. For example, exposure therapy is one of the leading ways to treat these disorders — but it sometimes stops working. To override past fears, the therapy promotes formation of new memories of safety; for example, a person who had a frightening incident with spiders might practice letting a harmless spider crawl on him. But since the same part of the brain is involved, whether creating the new safe memories or bringing up the older, fear-inducing ones, some competition for resources may come into play.

“The new memory does not erase the original fear memory but instead creates a new memory that inhibits or competes with the original fear,” Drew said. 

Given the new discovery, mental health professionals may need to rethink the duration and timing of exposure therapy, and pharmaceutical makers now have a new pathway for exploring ways to treat fear-based conditions.
