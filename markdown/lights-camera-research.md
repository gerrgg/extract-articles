From a 3-D printing vending machine, to nutrition needs for patients suffering with multiple sclerosis, to an exploration of the slogan Keep Austin Weird, undergraduates showed off their work at the first Texas Student Research Showdown.

As a leading public research university, The University of Texas at Austin continually expands the body of human knowledge. But research is not limited to faculty and graduate students, nor the hard core sciences. Students in all disciplines are encouraged to participate in research and the Office of Undergraduate Research, sponsor of the Showdown, helps them do so.

The statistics are impressive – 89 percent of undergraduates engage in some kind of research during their time at UT and 48 percent of UT undergraduates do research both inside and outside the classroom, according to the Office of Undergraduate Research. Given the exponential growth in technology and knowledge, research helps students look at topics in new ways and learn critical thinking skills that last beyond the project and into their future careers.

The Research Showdown began with a campus-wide invitation for undergraduates to submit their work in the form of a two-minute video. After posting, the undergraduate community was invited to vote on the videos, with six students making it into the presentation round. In this second stage, finalists gave a six-minute presentation describing their work to a panel of academic judges.

The finalists’ presentations were compelling for many reasons but particularly in the way their research reflected their personal interests and backgrounds.

Julia Chernis is a senior majoring in biochemistry and digital arts & media in the Bridging Disciplines Program. After hearing lots of misinformation, she combined her scientific background with her lifelong love of animation, to create her entry: a short animation that explains the science and safety of MRIs.

“It’s connected me to the world of research beyond UT and has taught me how to organize projects and manage my time better,” said Chernis. She encourages students to participate. “They should speak with the wonderful faculty in their department and be advised on what projects may interest them.”

First place winner Sanjai Bashyam is a junior in electrical engineering. His project centered on the Innovation Station, a 3D printing vending machine that provides free access to 3D printing to all students and faculty at UT.

“Research at UT has allowed me to discover what paths I want to pursue with my career,” said Bashyam. “I have also attended numerous conferences and developed my presentation skills immensely. Many of my interests have been shaped and piqued by my research.” The Showdown helped him develop skills in tailoring his presentation to the audience at hand and how to create a narrative of his work, focusing on how and why the research was conducted.

“Student researchers are rarely trained to communicate effectively about their work in terms of its relevance, but throughout their careers they’ll have to be able to talk to non-experts about why their research is important,” said Robert Reichle, of the Office of Undergraduate Research. “We want to help UT’s top students sell their ideas—and their stories as researchers—to this general audience.” He notes that all entrants walk away with a two-minute video that explains their work to friends, family, grad school committees.

Bashyam, who applied for and received an Undergraduate Research Fellowship from the Office of the Vice President for Research, has advice for students thinking about research:

“I would advise the student to not be too concerned with finding a research opportunity that fits their exact interests. The beginning of college is when you should explore multiple research opportunities and find what truly appeals to you. It may not be the first position but you will still gain valuable experience. Most importantly, talk to every professor you can and ask what you can do to get involved in their research.”
