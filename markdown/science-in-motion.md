### Using Science to Drive Change

Parenting is a hard, important job that comes with no instruction manual. Parents rely on family, friends and the internet for advice on raising children, but a robust body of science on parenting also can help – particularly regarding discipline, says expert Elizabeth Gershoff, the Amy Johnson McLaughlin Centennial Professor in UT Austin’s Department of Human Development and Family Sciences. 

Gershoff has conducted two decades of research on the effects of physically punishing children. Her findings include that the more children are spanked, the more likely they are to become aggressive, engage in anti-social behavior and experience mental-health and cognitive difficulties. Gershoff later helped both the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association implement policies stating that physical punishment is harmful and that their members should help parents learn other methods of discipline. Additionally, she co-edited a 2019 book summarizing evidence-based ways to reduce parents’ use of physical punishment. 

Nearly 60 countries have banned all physical punishment of children, and many consulted Gershoff’s research in the process. Invited by a number of countries’ governments to speak about her research, Gershoff also submitted policy briefs for countries that later implemented universal bans on physical punishment, including Scotland and Wales. Her research also brought change in the U.S., where physical punishment in public schools remains legal in Texas and 18 other states. The U.S. Department of Education cited her work in its call to end school corporal punishment, and three states since banned using physical punishment in schools on children with disabilities. 

Gershoff continues to work on this topic, noting, “It is incredibly gratifying when parents or schools or countries decide to forgo physical punishment on the basis of the scientific evidence.”

### How to Design a New Vaccine

Historically, scientists have made vaccines by crippling a disease-causing virus, for example with heat or chemicals. When this dead or weakened version of the virus is injected into a person, the immune system learns to recognize it and produce antibodies that prevent the virus from spreading. But what happens when the virus makes itself hard to recognize? A virus called RSV (for respiratory syncytial virus) that is most dangerous in childhood provides a good test case. Scientists like UT Austin’s Jason McLellan are pioneering a radical new way to make vaccines to tame RSV, currently the world’s second-leading viral killer in infants.

**Step-by-step**

Some people’s immune systems successfully fight RSV, a shape-shifting virus, so harvest a set of naturally produced antibodies from a person with the immunity.

Use a special, high-resolution tool, like cryogenic electron microscopy, to watch the virus and antibodies at work and see precisely where antibodies stick to the virus.

Design a molecule with the same shape and composition of the section of the virus that antibodies stick to.

Now test it. If when you inject the vaccine antigen into uninfected people, it results in the production of protective antibodies, you have done it: created a working vaccine in a whole new way.

### Cracking the Code

Freshman calculus and organic chemistry are the kinds of courses that can send shudders up the spines of many undergraduates. Both classes are where students take some of their earliest intensive, college-level mathematics and science. Now a pair of distinguished teaching professors at The University of Texas at Austin are among those using research to ensure students’ experiences in early courses like these create a solid foundation on which to build future success in STEM.

Uri Treisman, a professor of mathematics and director of the Charles A. Dana Center, and David Laude, professor of chemistry, have developed effective formulas that weave rigor and support into UT students’ experiences. Their efforts are helping more students start strong, with strategies steeped in educational research and celebrated in a 2019 book, _The Years that Matter Most: How College Makes or Breaks Us_. So what’s in the formula?

**Offer a reality check:** Many students worry about not belonging in college. Faculty now help new undergraduates understand how common that concern is, plus the ways that university staff and faculty are here to help. All UT students receive targeted lessons in how early classroom difficulties tend to be temporary and how, with the frustration, comes eventual growth.

**Keep the tough content intact:** A key way Treisman and Laude show respect for their students is setting a high bar. Challenging students keeps them motivated, while preparing them for the future in these disciplines. Students learn they can be leaders, right from the start.

**Create meaningful supports:** Treisman and Laude have developed a suite of tactics to help students succeed, from study groups to keeping close tabs on students as individuals, and checking in with them regularly. All Natural Sciences first-year students are matched with small, learning communities. Many experience real-word learning, too, in programs like the Freshman Research Initiative and the Inventors Program.

### One Photon at a Time

In physics, a hot area of research is studying what happens when ultrathin materials get stacked at a slight angle. Professor of physics Xiaoqin Elaine Li researches the resulting optical properties and works to control light emission, a single photon at a time. Such an innovation holds promise for making quantum information devices smaller, more efficient and more secure. While it may take years for these applications to be realized, Li believes work now with these materials will pave the way for breakthroughs to come.

“Investigating new quantum materials can transform the way we live,” she said.

**A curious geometry called a moiré pattern arises when physicists stack ultrathin materials at an angle.**

**The twisted two-layer material is carved into repeating, rolling hills of energetic ups and downs.**

**Like marbles bound by gravity, individual electrons settle into the lowest allowed energy state ‘valleys’ in the material.**

**Forced to obey a specific arrangement and bound by quantum laws, the electrons then occupy an array of ‘boxes’ scientists can control just by twisting.**

**Once the electrons are boxed in, scientists excite them with a burst of energy. This transforms the settled electrons into energized light-emitters, which, operating at the theoretical limits allowed by quantum physics, would emit a single photon at a time.**
