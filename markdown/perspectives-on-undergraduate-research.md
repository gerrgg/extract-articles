The School of Undergraduate Studies and the [Office of Undergraduate Research](https://ugs.utexas.edu/our) hosted events across the Forty Acres showcasing undergraduate research and creative projects for [Research Week](https://ugs.utexas.edu/research-week). We talked with students at the [Bridging Disciplines Programs](https://ugs.utexas.edu/bdp) (BDP) poster session and the Longhorn Research Poster Session to get their take on conducting undergraduate research and how it has enhanced their time at The University of Texas at Austin. Our thanks to everyone who participated in the week’s events. View a photo gallery from poster sessions at the bottom of this post.

Computer Science Senior  
BDP: Global Studies  
Poster: How International Aid Influences Terrorism in North Africa

Haley started college studying biology and quickly realized the major wasn’t for her. Instead, she found computer science as a way to combine her love of math and science. After enjoying a government course, she realized she could combine all of her interests with the help of a BDP. She researched how foreign aid affects the number of terrorist attacks in North Africa.

“It took me a while to figure it out, but the BDP was my way of learning as much as I could about security without actually doing an international relations and global studies major and this was my way of exploring my interests,” Hayley said.

Radio-Television-Film Senior  
BDP: Museum Studies  
Poster: Ethical Implications of Public and Private Polish Film Poster Collections in the Austin Area

Laurel combined several of her interests into a research project on Polish film posters. She found that the subversive and surreal posters for Hollywood movies created under Communist rule often survived only in private collections. She examined whether amateur collectors have as much credibility as institutions when collecting material culture.

“I’m interested in Polish cinema and I’m studying Polish right now. This research has helped me integrate my major in Radio-Television-Film with history, Polish, and museums,” Laurel said.

Art History Senior  
BDP: Museum Studies  
Poster: Digitally Mapping 16th Century Mexico

Using Google Maps and a document from the 16th century housed in the [Benson Latin American Collection](https://www.lib.utexas.edu/about/locations/benson), Lindsey tracked demographic changes in indigenous Mexican towns, finding some had modern equivalents while others disappeared over time. Lindsey never pictured herself conducting research in college and she is more interested in modern Latin American art, but saw the experience as a way to gain background information and historical perspective.

“I’m an art history major and this is a little outside the wheelhouse of even things that art history professors at UT are doing. I didn’t expect myself to be into this time period or even this geographical region,” Lindsey said. “I think this is probably one of the only ways in my time at UT to get any technological experience. That’s not something, unless I sought it out, that I’d be doing in my normal curriculum.”

**Conner Dimoush**  
Mechanical Engineering Sophomore  
Poster: Designing Lighting Systems for Robots in Omnidirectional Cameras

As a member of the Nuclear and Applied Robotics Group at the Pickle Research Campus, Conner combined a longtime hobby and his engineering studies for a research project. The robotics group designs robots to enter hazardous conditions; his role is focused on how to determine if the lighting system for the robot is bright enough for the work it will be doing.

“It takes research to develop new products or technologies. If you’re interested in being an innovator, you might want to look into research,” Conner said.

**Feiruz Deres**  
Government Senior  
Poster: Implementing Energy Efficiency Policies in East Africa

Feiruz created a research project to fit her interests in government, energy policies, and East Africa to study the implementation of policies around energy efficiency in Kenya and Ethiopia

“I realized that the department of government gives you this opportunity to do research and it can be whatever you want it to be as long as it’s related to government,” Feiruz said. Her advice: “Talk to your own professors, get involved within your own department, and go to information sessions.”

Nutrition Senior  
Poster: The Health of Hispanic Young Adults Under the Affordable Care Act

Nicholas looked at the most recent data on the implementation of the Affordable Care Act to see how it affected Hispanic young adults. Seeing room for improvement, he came to the conclusion that marketing should target this demographic to stress what really matters to them like staying healthy and providing for their families.

“I really didn’t plan to do research when I got to college,” Nicholas said. “Before all this, I didn’t know how to navigate databases, write reports, or do critical analysis. I gained experience in learning how to deal with a project this large and being confident in myself to explore new things.”

**Ana de Salvidea**  
Undergraduate Studies Freshman  
Poster: Trophy Head Ritual of the Nazca

Ana’s research project came from classwork in Astrid Runggaldier’s class “Art and Archeology in Ancient Peru.” The class was charged with analyzing an object housed in the Fine Arts Library to make new discoveries about its use and origins for a “museum card” that would accompany the object in the collection.

“If you have the opportunity to get into research, definitely go for it. It was my first year in college and you grow in that year, but this gives that growth more depth,” Ana said. “You can learn new skills, meet new people, and work directly with a professor. Just go for it!”

History Senior  
Poster: Analysis of a Nazca Ceramic

Working with Nazca ceramics in the same “Art and Archeology in Ancient Peru” course, Abigail discovered the value of campus resources like the Fine Arts Library.

“Honestly, the Fine Arts Library is so important. It’s not only where these ceramics were on display with the original museum card project, but it’s where I did nearly all of my research,” Abigail said. “I was able to pull out book after book on Nazca ceramics. I know French and was able to read books on the Nazca ceramics in French, which I thought was incredible! I wouldn’t have been able to do this research project without it.”

Psychology Junior  
Poster: Mental Health Disparities Among Indigenous Women in Guatemala

Kelly conducted her research project during a Maymester in Guatemala where she studied data from the World Health Organization and conducted interviews with Mayan women to understand their views on the mental healthcare system. She will continue to research the healthcare system when she is studying abroad in London this summer.

“I never expected to do any kind of research. I did this project in my first year and I am pretty excited about what I found,” Kelly said. “It’s even more meaningful when you’re interviewing people like this and getting real-world experience and not just looking at papers that other people have written.”
