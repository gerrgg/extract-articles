Measuring more than 70-feet-long and 20-feet-high, and incorporating a full 90-degree corner, a state-of-the-art green screen provides new opportunities for Moody College of Communication undergraduate and graduate students to incorporate digital compositing and virtual sets in their film and video productions.

“It’s exciting to see the myriad of ways this will benefit the creative minds in the film industry now that we have an unparalleled green screen production set,” said [Jay Bernhardt](https://commstudies.utexas.edu/faculty/jay-m-bernhardt), dean of Moody College. “This truly sets us apart for one-of-a-kind opportunities to explore and expand creative potential.”

After years of funding, planning and construction, the [Department of Radio-Television-Film](https://rtf.utexas.edu/) in the [Moody College of Communication](https://moody.utexas.edu/) recently completed a professional, state-of-the-art green screen in the CMB building on the sixth floor.

The green screen, along with the recently updated motion capture studio, builds the digital media muscle for Moody College.

“A big part of my teaching is placing students in touch with professional quality gear, studio spaces, our motion capture studio and now this amazing green screen,” said Radio-Television-Film Lecturer [Ben Bays](https://rtf.utexas.edu/faculty/ben-bays). “Because we have these assets, our students will go out into these industries well-trained with the ability to become proficient leaders in the field.” 

Bays teaches classes such as digital media production, introduction to 3D animation, computer graphics for film and games and introduction to visual effects.

“Narrative filmmaking is increasingly reliant on the digital compositing of background images,” said Bays. “This allows students access to expert production stages, where a large green screen is a standard requirement used to film multiple sets and large panoramic shots using a digital background replacement.”

Radio-Television-Film senior David Granberry said using the motion capture studio and green screen facilities set the film program apart and allows students the opportunity for more creative options in making films.

“Take the class—it’s a cool class,” said Granberry, student of the introduction to visual effects course. “You learn a lot and I think you learn how to tell stories in more unique ways than the traditional narrative way.”
