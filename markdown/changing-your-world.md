### Jacob Vines wants to help heal hands.

#### Jacob Vines, ’19

**Major:** Kinesiology

Jacob wants to change the world with breakthroughs in neurological therapy.

Whether we are buttoning a shirt or holding a fork, pinching is something we do thousands of times a day, usually without thinking about it. But Jacob Vines thinks about it a lot.

The research Jacob has done at UT on fine motor function has steered him toward a life of serving others in need of hand rehabilitation. And after graduation this year, Jacob plans to work for a year as a technician in a physical therapy facility then enroll in a physical therapy graduate program and become a therapist.

“I’ve always liked research,” says the kinesiology senior from Abilene. At UT, he joined the Motor Coordination Lab in the College of Education. “I thought joining a lab would be a good growing experience to learn how research is conducted.” Grow he did, and last year, he was awarded the university’s Undergraduate Research Fellowship for his project examining the neuromuscular forces involved in fine motor abilities such as pinching.

In the study he designed, subjects move a cursor around a screen in a diamond shape using different combinations of force on sensors from the thumb and index finger to control the direction. Like the classic toy Etch A Sketch — in which one dial controls vertical position and the other horizontal — here, the pressure from the index finger controls the cursor’s vertical position while the pressure from the thumb controls its horizontal position.

By measuring the subjects’ accuracy, Jacob is hoping to learn more about the nuances of how the brain and muscles coordinate to accomplish this seemingly simple undertaking. His results could lead to new therapeutic tasks for patients with neurological problems, providing better ways of measuring improvement during rehabilitation.

### Kelsey Mumford wants to help Texas become a healthier state.

#### Kelsey Mumford , ’19

**Major:** Nursing Honors, Biology

Kelsey wants to change your world with policies that prevent illness.

Growing up in the Austin area, senior Kelsey Mumford experienced the impact a top-tier research university can have on a community. “I saw the work UT was doing, and it was the only school I applied to,” she says. Little did she know when she was a little girl dressing up in Texas Cheer uniforms for Halloween that one day she would be representing the university on a state and national level as an advocate for better health policies.

Kelsey hit the ground running as a freshman, double majoring in nursing honors and biology. Outside of the classroom she was very involved as a Forty Acres Scholar, the School of Nursing representative in Student Government, a Texas Coed cheerleader and the Health Policy Committee chair of the UT Nursing Students Association.

During her sophomore year, the dean of the nursing school sent her to a student policy summit in Washington, D.C., designed to immerse student nurses in the federal policy process. At the summit, Kelsey had the opportunity to apply for a small grant to take what she learned back to UT. She won, and designed a three-month campaign to get other students excited about advocating for better health in the Austin community.

She organized about 70 students, who advocated to pass a bill in the Texas Legislature. The policy was a small change in the driver’s license application. Instead of checking a box to opt in to being an organ donor in Texas, you would instead have the option to opt out. “It was a very small thing, but it could have a large impact on the bigger system,” says Kelsey. “It’s an example of how a health policy on a specific issue can have a chain reaction. Health policy is not just big national bills. These state and local bills are really important.”

During her junior year, Kelsey was awarded the Nurse in Washington Internship. She received the program’s only full scholarship for a student. Kelsey was able to meet with Texas legislative staffers to discuss issues such as the opioid crisis. The goal of one bill discussed was to provide advanced-practice registered nurses with greater ability to prescribe naloxone and other opioid addiction treatments.

Kelsey has always wanted to help people. That is why she got into nursing. With these experiences, she sees a future for how to do that on a larger scale.

“I’m really interested in preventative policies. How can we prevent people from getting sick in the first place? I want to know in the future that I’ve helped Texas become a healthier state.”

Now in her senior year, Kelsey has not slowed down. She serves on the Board of Directors of the National Student Nurses Association, is founder of the Health Advocacy Student Coalition, and program coordinator for the Dell Medical School Health Leadership Apprentice Program.

After graduating in May, Kelsey plans to attend graduate school and continue health advocacy in her career.

“Health is important to have a thriving society. It’s something that every single person has dealt with. Either they or someone they know has been sick. So how can I not focus on a policy area that will touch everyone?”

### Anastasiya Byelousova wants Texas mothers to survive and thrive.

#### Anastasiya Byelousova, ’20

**Major:** Plan II Honors

Anastasiya is traveling across the world to search for solutions to a surprisingly big problem in Texas — maternal mortality.

UT junior Anastasiya Byelousova won’t be spending the summer at home in San Antonio. She will be traveling across the world in search of solutions to a surprisingly big problem in Texas – maternal mortality.

Women dying during pregnancy, childbirth or the first few weeks of motherhood should not be a problem in the United States, but it is. In fact, the United States has one of the highest maternal mortality rate of any country in the developed world, and Texas has one of the highest rates in the U.S.

“Pregnancy-related deaths are a devastating tragedy that leave many Texas families broken,” says Gov. Greg Abbott, and the state has committed resources to finding solutions to this problem. Anastasiya believes researchers at UT, including other undergraduate students, could help.

Her suggestion — Texas should look to an unexpected success story, Georgia. The Republic of Georgia, not the state, recently turned around its high maternal mortality rates. The questions Anastasiya is asking are: Can Texas repeat their success, and if so, how?

“In just two years Georgia halved their maternal mortality,” says Anastasiya. “There’s not a lot of research done in Georgia as to why that happened or how that happened, so we are going to travel there.”

Anastasiya is one of four undergraduate students from The University of Texas at Austin leading this international research project. The project is funded by [President’s Award for Global Learning](https://presidentsglobalaward.utexas.edu/), which grants up to $25,000 and fully funded travel to find solutions abroad to problems affecting Texans.

“We’re going to be able to meet with government officials, go into the hospitals and speak with doctors, and also speak with expecting mothers or mothers who recently gave birth. We are going to try to piece this puzzle together,” she says, “collecting research on what is happening in Georgia and from that learning how to apply their success in Texas.”

Anastasiya and her teammates Parth Gupta, Michael Sanchez and Lyndsey Wang will be in the country for 10 weeks this summer. The students will be accompanied by government professor Amy Liu and sociology professor Sharmila Rudrappa.

Anastasiya says this is exactly the type of experience she dreamed about when she applied to UT. After graduation, she is determined that the work she does with her degree will have a real impact on the lives of others.

But right now, she has her sights set on the problem before her. Anastasiya says she feels immensely proud that work she is doing now could help save the lives of Texas mothers in the future.

### Zeyi Lin wants to cut your commute.

#### Zeyi Lin, BS ’18

**Major:** Electrical and Computer Engineering

Helping Texans get home sooner is his passion.

Zeyi Lin begins with an understatement: “Austin has grown.” And, as he says, “traffic is not going to magically get better.” Austin is infamous for traffic. A 30-minute commute takes 50 minutes during rush hour, on a good day.

Growing up in Austin, senior Zeyi Lin knows the frustration of sitting on I-35 after a long day. During the past decade, as the city grew rapidly, Lin experienced more traffic everywhere he went.

Combining his two majors — electrical and computer engineering and the humanities-focused Plan II Honors program — Lin became interested in the ethics of engineering. How might it be used as a force for good? How could engineering help solve big problems for fellow Texans?

So with funding from the Texas Department of Transportation and guidance from Dr. Joydeep Ghosh, Lin set about researching ways to make driving safer and more efficient. His team developed a sensor system to detect objects around cars and track where and why traffic congestion happens. The hope, Lin says, is that their findings will help the state better understand how to improve infrastructure and decrease traffic on Texas roadways.

Lin says his UT education has helped him better understand traffic and how innovation can help us find a way out of the traffic mess.

### Marwan Madi wants to empower Texas farmers with drones.

#### Marwan Madi, ’20

**Major:** Electrical and Computer Engineering

Bringing new technology to agriculture is Marwan’s innovation.

Ever since his senior year of high school in Sugar Land, Marwan Madi saw the potential for “precision agriculture” using drones that can detect the health or stress of vegetation.

Now an engineering junior at UT, he is putting this idea to use as a co-founder of the drone services startup Maverick Labs. The university recently allowed him to try out the technology on the thirstiest part of campus, the lawn in front of the LBJ Library. Those results are not in yet, but he thinks the savings in water consumption could be significant.

Marwan now has an opportunity to apply this technology on a bigger scale. A chance encounter last year with a cotton and corn farmer led to an invitation to try out the technology on farms around El Campo, on the coastal plains southwest of Houston. These proof-of-concept flights mean numerous trips to the area for Marwan and his business partner, when Marwan is not in class pursuing an electrical and computer engineering degree.

These drones use multispectral sensors that calculate the ratio of visible light to near-infrared light. This sophisticated sensor can even detect weeds and tell the farmer what kind of weeds they are.

The technology already exists. Marwan’s innovation comes in providing that coordinated service. “Not only do you have to purchase the drone, you have to purchase the software and the sensor, and have an FAA certification.”

“What we’re predicting and what the data show so far is we are going to be able to save farmers a lot of money on chemicals and fertilizers as well as water,” says Marwan. “Margins are very small in farming. They need all the help they can get.” The margins are small, but the economic impact to Texas of the food and fiber sector totals more than $100 billion annually.

“It’s been a great experience so far, and I’m looking forward to what we can do with this new service,” Marwan says. So are Texas farmers.

### Emmalie wants to bring world-class health care to small-town Texas.

#### Emmalie Berkovsky, BS ’17, Dell Med ’21

**Major:** Chemical Engineering/ Doctor of Medicine

Growing up in a small town has many perks, but world-class medical care isn’t always one of them. That is why Dell Med student Emmalie Berkovsky plans to return to her hometown of Shiner to serve the community she loves.

When you grow up in a small town, everyone is family, according to UT medical student Emmalie Berkovsky.

Emmalie grew up in Shiner, a Central Texas town of about 2,000 residents. “It’s one of those places that’s not just where you grew up. It’s your home,” she says. “Everyone is really tight-knit.”

Her hometown stayed close to her heart when she left to attend school in Austin. Emmalie graduated with a bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering from the [Cockrell School of Engineering](http://www.engr.utexas.edu/) in 2017, then moved across campus to the [Dell Medical School](https://dellmed.utexas.edu/). Her dream — to become a great doctor and return to serve the community she loves.

Growing up in a small town has many perks, but world-class medical care isn’t always one of them. “Shiner, because it’s so rural, is medically underserved,” says Emmalie. “It’s 50 miles to the closest large health center.” That means instead of hospitals, residents of Shiner and the surrounding towns rely on small family practices for all their care.

Your primary care doctor is who you see for everything, she says. “My doctor delivered me, and I saw him my whole life until I moved away.”

She says that although her family doctor was great, the scope of what his practice could do was limited. If you needed surgery or had a complicated illness, you had to travel to Austin, San Antonio or Houston to get treatment — a big problem for people struggling with urgent health issues.

Emmalie knows firsthand the heartache this can cause. When she was in middle school, her grandmother became seriously sick. She had an obstruction in her stomach and was told by doctors in nearby Victoria that there was nothing they could do. Emmalie’s family was devastated.

“No one should ever be told that it’s their time just because no one in their town has the ability to help them,” she laments. Her grandmother ended up moving to San Antonio for treatment and lived many years after that, but the episode stuck with Emmalie.

Currently in her clinical year at Dell Med, Emmalie is passionate about the impact primary care can have on people’s lives for prevention and early detection. When she graduates, she plans to return home with her training in community-centered care.

“Good care starts at the local level. That way, you never get to the point of being told that there’s nothing more we can do,” she says.

### Liam Harlan is bringing research results to Texans faster.

#### Liam Harlan, ’19

**Major:** Chemical Engineering

Liam Harlan wants to use data to fast-track advances in chemical engineering. Because the state of Texas has a first-class research university, this valedictorian didn’t have to leave Texas to get the experience a top researcher needs.

Because Abilene’s Liam Harlan came to UT after graduating as valedictorian, he is way ahead of most students his age when it comes to scientific research.

In Liam’s first semester on campus, he enrolled in UT’s [Freshman Research Initiative](https://cns.utexas.edu/fri), joining a research team investigating how to optimize hydrogen fuel cells. In his second semester, he began an independent study of tungsten, which plays a major role in the microelectronics industry. This in turn led to a summer research fellowship.

One thing led to another, and soon Liam was interfacing with some of the fastest supercomputers on Earth, working — as an undergraduate — at UT’s own [Texas Advanced Computing Center](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/). “Getting connected to TACC allowed us to do a lot more.” he says. “TACC can do the work of a year in a week,” Liam says. “It increases efficiency for many researchers.”

Because of that experience, Liam can now see how data processing could have huge effects on the area he’s majoring in, chemical engineering. And that could have enormous effects on the Texas and American economy.

### Janelle Chavez is expanding access to care for medically underserved communities

#### Janelle Chavez, ’19

**Major:** Biology

Biology major Janelle Chavez ventured to Austin for her education and plans to return to the Valley to improve health care.

Janelle Chavez grew up in Port Isabel. Living with her four grandparents, she saw them struggle with broken bones, heart disease and cancer. Those emotional experiences inspired Janelle. “I knew I wanted to be a physician.”

Now a Forty Acres Scholar, Janelle has worked at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Harvard Medical School, McGovern Medical School, the Texas Children’s and Memorial Hermann Hospital, and UT’s Dell Medical School. All along her journey, she says, “I’ve seen patients who remind me of my grandparents.”

Both her childhood in the Rio Grande Valley and clinical training in Peru taught her the importance of access to health care and especially women’s health care. In Cameron County, where she grew up, the death rate from cervical cancer is significantly higher than elsewhere in Texas. Janelle wants to find ways to expand the state’s health care system in this low-income area at the tip of Texas. “I want to make a difference in Texas,” she says, “and take that out to the world.”

Though she traveled to Austin for her education, Janelle plans to return to the Valley to do medical research.

### Ricky Cooks is looking to advance social causes through business.

#### Ricky Cooks, ’21

**Major:** Business Honors and Government

Ricky Cooks, a student in UT’s McCombs School of Business, wants to use his degree to build the economy of Texas and lift local communities.

Ricky Cooks believes in the power of business to change lives. Like his hometown of Texarkana, which straddles the Texas-Arkansas border, he has a foot in two worlds — social change and big business. “Whatever you might be passionate about, there’s an economic force behind it,” Ricky says.

A dual major business honors and government sophomore, he is studying the economic forces that change lives. When Ricky graduates, he wants to find a way to help others and make a profit. The state of Texas, he says, is the perfect place to do that.

The $1.8 trillion Texas economy is the second largest in America. “We are such a big stakeholder in the success of the United States,” Ricky says, “I’ve never pictured myself working anywhere else.”

Ricky was drawn to business after meeting Gary Kusin, a fellow alumnus of Texas High School in Texarkana, 1972 UT graduate, and Texas Exes Life Member. Kusin, the founder of GameStop and former CEO of FedEx Kinkos, returns to Texas High School every year to mentor top students like Ricky. They talk about how to make the most of college and beyond. Today, Ricky still calls him for advice.

It’s easy to get confused about your options and where to funnel your passion, Ricky notes. Because it was a mentorship that set him on a path to success, he takes time away from studying to make himself available to high school students from his hometown. “I care a lot about giving back to the Texarkana community. I make a huge point to tell students from my high school, even if you’re not interested in UT, you can talk to me about college. I want you to be as prepared as possible for your future.”

### Andrea Chee is making speech therapy accessible for all Texans.

#### Andrea Chee, BS ’18

**Major:** Speech Communication

El Paso’s Andrea Chee wants Texans with speech challenges to succeed. “Communication is important,” she says. “It’s the foundation of everything we do.”

As a girl, Andrea Chee watched her grandmother struggle in the aftermath of a sudden and debilitating stroke. It was a speech language pathologist who helped her grandmother speak again.

Andrea came to Texas as an undergraduate to study communication sciences and disorders. She had the chance to work at the Michael and Tami Lang Stuttering Institute under Courtney Byrd, a top specialist in childhood stuttering treatments. Andrea worked one-on-one with children and adults who stutter and learned how to plan and execute their therapy.

Her dream is to make speech therapy more accessible and affordable to Texans who currently lack those resources by opening a nonprofit speech clinic offering free services. Andrea plans to return home to El Paso.

Whether therapy means giving a child the courage to raise her hand in class or helping someone tell their grandchild they love them, Andrea says communication is priceless. “It’s the foundation of everything we do.”
